# **MAZE GAME PROJECT**

## Project Description:
Maze Game is a simple third-person game where you start at one entrance and try to solve the maze to get through to the exit. We used DFS to randomly create a path for the maze and used Unreal Engine to realize this idea. Procedurally generated Maze Game by Unreal Engine.

Maze Game is currently in progress, you can see our plans for improvements [here](https://github.com/bucket420/MazeGame/issues).
